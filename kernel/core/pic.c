 * programmable interrupt controller functions (PIC)

 * to learn more about PICs check out these links:
 * https://wiki.osdev.org/8259_PIC
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8259

 * basically the original 8259 offered a PIC with 8 IRQ ports but it also had this
 * cascade mode where you can plug in other PIC(s) into IRQ ports so you could get
 * 64 IRQs (8 IRQ ports, 8 PICs, 8*8 = 64)

 * the PIC that you plug the other PIC(s) into is called the master and the PIC(s)
 * ou plug into the master is called slaves

 * IBM PC AT took advantage of this cascade mode by connecting a single slave to
 * master PIC's third IRQ port, and for some reason this two-chip architecture is
 * still used and available in modern systems, and hasn't changed

 * as the time went on, PICs got embedded into motherboard's southboard also intel
 * dropped APIC which is advanced PIC, and it is basically available on any
 * multiproccessor system, however it's more complicated and shit

 * so i'll go with the basic PIC and who the actual fuck is gonna use all the IRQs anyway
